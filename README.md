### Project Flagship
I ran out of creativity when I was supposed to name this project,
but the basic idea was a "betting-pool" where league of legends players could
challenge each-other to a match, betting money on the outcome of the game.

I wanted to try out Deno as the runtime, and this was my first experience.

Very early in the project I got side-tracked when trying to find an ORM, so I started creating my own.

This code is +4 years old and Deno didn't have any well-documented, typed ORMs at that point. 
I didn't get very far, the basic in-memory one or file based implementation was sufficient for my needs.

I did add fast integration tests, with a real server, which I'm proud of!

It was fun learning about generics, I didn't take the step into the world of polymorphism, but I think that would have been 
the next step
